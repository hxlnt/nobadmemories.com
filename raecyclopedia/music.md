    question: How do you record a stereo instrument with the Audient iD4?
    answer: Technically, the Audient iD4 only has a single (mono) instrument input. However, you can use the microphone input as a second line in to record live stereo audio with two 1/4" TS cables. Because the gain ranges differ on each input, the gain for the microphone input needs to be increased relative to the gain for the instrument input. For the best adjustment, check the L and R levels on a signal known to have equal levels in each channel to confirm that the levels are equal after gain adjustment.

    question: What MIDI commands enable the percussion kit?
    answer: By convention, Channel 10 is usef for percussion. Control codes and data are sent in the same way as they are for instruments. But instead of pitches, the data byte specifies the part of the kit to play.

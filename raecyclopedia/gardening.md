    question: How can you fix a malfunctioning water sensor in an Aerogarden?
    answer: The sensor float may be in the wrong position or the tube that houses it might contain debris or roots. You can remove the sensor float with a magnet, check for debris, and then reseat the float to get the sensor working again.

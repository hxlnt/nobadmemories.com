                <p>In November of 2020, the boxes began to really stack up. A few by the hallway, then a looming tower near the kitchen, then more rows assembled in the dining room.</p>
<p>Spurred by months of COVID-19-induced isolation at home, I'd put myself on a mission to finally go through all my possessions, even those banished to the far corners of the garage, and organize, downsize, and declutter.</p>
<p>Around the same time, my thoughts turned to making a charitable donation. Given the difficult circumstances 2020 brought, I wanted to be thoughtful about making a positive impact for those affected.</p>
<p>One thought led to another, and eventually I came up with the idea to host a online holiday silent action-slash-garage sale to pass my gently-used items on to others and to raise money for a local mutual aid organization. I had four main objectives for the silent auction:</p>
<ul>
<li>to pass on useful, gently-used items to a good home,</li>
<li>to raise money for a charitable cause (<a href="https://www.gofundme.com/f/kick-the-cold-austin-mutal-aid">Austin Mutual Aid</a>),</li>
<li>to create a unique avenue to connect and have fun with friends remotely, and</li>
<li>to help activate my friends to think about ways <em>they</em> can be involved in something important to them.</li>
</ul>
<p>The event ran for two weeks in December and raised $1,648. Now that I've had a few weeks to reflect on it, I'm sharing a bit of a post-mortem on the event in case it's useful for others wanting to undertake something similar.</p>
<h2>Event overview</h2>
<p>Here is an outline of how I ran the event.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Triaged my items.</strong> I went through the boxes and found <em>the fun stuff:</em> instruments, movies, etc. Clothing was taken to a local mutual aid stand.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Created a Discord server.</strong> This was pretty easy to intuit, but you can also find a guide to setting up a Discord server <a href="https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/204849977-How-do-I-create-a-server-">here</a>. I created a <code>#rules</code> channel where I posted <a href="#">bidding rules</a>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Sent invites.</strong> Two weeks before the event, I sent an email with the Discord join link, an explanation of the event, and a call for donations from others.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Grouped items into thematic bundles.</strong> A collection of children's books, movies, and craft supplies became a rainy-day &quot;kids' bundle;&quot; A bass guitar was paired with an amplifier and live music DVD to form a &quot;rock bundle.&quot;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Photographed and created Discord channels for each bundle.</strong></p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>I felt excited to downsize, then guilty for <em>having stuff</em>, then nervous wondering if I'd inherited my late grandmother's hoarding propensity, then sad to consider what might meet its end in landfills.</p>
<p>I should first note that the extent of my prior experience with fundraising was selling Girl Scout cookies as a child. This was also my first time spinning up my own Discord server. I mention this to lay out that <em>I'm not really an expert here.</em> I went into this endeavor with an appetite to learn and try something out of my comfort zone for a good cause. OK, with that disclaimer out of the way, here are the steps I took.</p>
<p>Regarding the last point, I was inspired by my friend <a href="https://www.adamconover.net/">Adam Conover</a>, who shares a lot of earnest community activism and volunteer work to the many followers who know him from his TV and comedy career. It made me think about how infectious positive attitudes and actions can be.</p>
<p>I had initially considered running the silent auction through something like Google Sheets or Forms, but I wanted to be sure that everyone participating could see bids without modifying them. I also wanted an avenue for conversation. Discord was my next candidate for handling this. It could also allow participants to set up notifications if desired.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>This will work kind of like eBay without eBay. Each auction bundle has its own Discord channel with an item description, photos, and a minimum starting bid. To place a bid, simply post a dollar amount in the channel. If you are the first bidder, your bid must be equal to or greater than the starting bid. If you are not the first bidder, your bid must be $1 or more greater than the previous bid.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Bidding starts at 12:01 AM on December 4 and ends at 11:59 PM on December 18. For each bundle, the person who has posted the highest bid in that bundle's channel when bidding closes will win the bundle and agrees to pay their highest bid amount.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Editing bids is not permitted.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Each auction bundle contains a curated selection of multiple items united by a theme. Bundles cannot be split or rearranged. If you are the winner of a bundle, let me know if there's something in the bundle you don't want, and I will donate it to Goodwill.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Most items are gently used except where indicated. Photos should help address concerns about item condition. But also, like, this is a garage sale. Everything is as-is, no exchanges, returns, or refunds.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Winners will be messaged on Discord to arrange for payment and delivery (within Austin only). I'll donate all proceeds and match them dollar for dollar to Austin Mutual Aid's &quot;Kick the Cold&quot; fundraising campaign. They're halfway to their $20,000 goal! https://www.gofundme.com/f/kick-the-cold-austin-mutal-aid</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If you want to donate cash (and have your donation matched) but don't want to bid on anything, head over to the #⛲・wishing-well channel.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>This is meant to provide a lighthearted way to raise money for a good cause while keeping unused items out of landfills and dusty garages. While healthy competition is encouraged, please be mindful that each of us is in unique circumstances in these awful times. Don't feel obligated to overbid or participate at all. And don't be a jerk. I know you won't, though. :heart:</p>

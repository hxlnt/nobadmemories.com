Nearly one year ago, [I blogged about thinning the contents of my bookshelf](http://nobadmemories.com/blog/2017/09/inches-of-books/) to contain just my most essential reference materials. My goal was to squeeze everything into four 13" shelves (hence, 52 inches of books).

I've more or less maintained the same footprint since then, but books have come into and out of rotation. I was curious to see what books stuck around for the year, which ones went on loan to friends or departed to greener pastures, and which ones gained must-have status.

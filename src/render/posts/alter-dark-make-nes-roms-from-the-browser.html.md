Last week, I had the honor of speaking at [NodeConf EU](http://www.nodeconf.eu) about a new project I've been working on called Alter Dark. Alter Dark allows you to patch NES ROMs in the browser via a REST API. I've demonstrated one use of this API: [making customized NES greeting cards or "screensavers" in the browser](http://www.nobadmemories.com/alterdark).

Future applications could allow users to add their own graphics and sound. Or, an interface could be created for patching NES ROMs in other ways. See the video below for a quick tour and explanation of the project.

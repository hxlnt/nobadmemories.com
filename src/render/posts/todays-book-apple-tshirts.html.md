Yesterday, I picked up this great find for just $8 at a used book store in Dallas: *Apple T-Shirts: A Yearbook of History at Apple Computer.*

![Apple T-Shirts by Gordon Thygeson](https://hxlntblob.blob.core.windows.net/nbm/appletshirtscover.JPG)

This hardcover book, published in 1997, tells the history of Apple Computer through one-off and low-run t-shirts made for internal programs, conferences, product teams, or just for fun. These shirts reflect the attitudes and culture within Apple in the 1980s and 1990s, and show off unique unreleased products and demos like SegaMac (!!!).

This book is definitely recommended for those interested in computer history or graphic design at Apple.

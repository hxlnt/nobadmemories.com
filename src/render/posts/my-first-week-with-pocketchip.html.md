About a week ago, I received a brand-new PocketCHIP, and I haven't been able to put it down since. Insofar as one can be an expert after just a week, I decided to put together all that I've learned, built, and, *ahem*, broken so far.

## What is PocketCHIP?

Next Thing Co.'s [PocketCHIP](https://getchip.com/pages/pocketchip]) looks like what you might get if you crossed a Raspberry Pi with a Game Boy.

The PocketCHIP is a hackable computer with a touchscreen display, QWERTY keyboard, rechargeable battery, GPIO breakouts, headphone jack, WiFi, and bluetooth, all in one adorable handheld device. The brain of the PocketCHIP is the CHIP, a $9 Linux computer with a 1 GHz ARM7 processor and 512 MB RAM. 

Admittedly, the touchscreen is a little finicky, the keyboard a little fatiguing for extended use, the 512 MB of RAM a little short, and the plastic casing a little creaky. But overall, it feels like a great deal of care went into the design and that the right tradeoffs for value and cost were made. (The PocketCHIP currently retails for $69 USD.) Little touches like the pencil stand, lanyard hole, faceted case, and beautiful graphic design have tremendous impact.

## Installing new software on PocketCHIP

PocketCHIP comes with a few applications preloaded; among them, the [Pico-8 game console-plus-IDE](http://www.lexaloffle.com/pico-8.php) steals the show. But what if you want to venture into new territory with your device?

To find applications that you may be able to install on the PocketCHIP, you can take a look the [Debian Jessie Package listing](https://packages.debian.org/jessie/) and browse stable-release packages that list supported architecture as "all" or "armhf." If you find an application you want to try, first ensure that you've connected to WiFi from the Home Screen settings menu. Then, you can install software by opening the Terminal and entering `sudo apt-get install name-of-package` where *name-of-package* is the name of the package you want to install per the Debian package website. 

Speaking of `sudo`, the default PocketCHIP password for commands prefixed with `sudo` is *chip.* You should probably change that at some point. It's easy: just enter the command `passwd` into Terminal and follow the directions provided.

Note that before you install your first application, you should run `sudo apt-get update` to update APT (the "Advanced Package Tool"). To remove a package that you no longer want, enter `sudo apt-get remove name-of-package`.

Applications you install won't be automatically added to the Home Screen, though some folks have posted tutorials for customizing Home Screens on [the Next Thing Co. forums](https://bbs.nextthing.co/). Applications you install can be opened from Terminal. 

Did you know that PocketCHIP already comes with some applications that aren't on the Home Screen? For example, a web browser can be accessed from Terminal by typing `surf nobadmemories.com`.

## The hard way: Building from source

Even if the whole package manager thing sounds ilke a chore, this is definitely among the easiest and most reliable ways to get applications on to your PocketCHIP. The alternative is to build from source code. This entails various tool installations, forum reading, and the patience and tenacity to start from scratch when you inevitably mess it up the first time around. As it turns out, I unwittingly stepped into such a project last week.

While I was waiting for my PocketCHIP to arrive, I started reading through [the forums](http://bbs.nextthing.co) to see what people were doing with it. I came across a thread where people were talking about which Debian application was best to install on the PocketCHIP for editing code. This gave me the idea to install the [VS Code IDE](http://code.visualstudio.com) once my PocketCHIP shipped because I love using it for web dev on Mac and PC. 

I knew Microsoft had released Linux binaries of VS Code, so... how hard could it be, right? Soon after my PocketCHIP arrived, and propelled by sheer enthusiasm alone, I got to work. 

As it turned out, while there were [a number of 32- and 64-bit Linux packages](https://code.visualstudio.com/#alt-downloads) available from the VS Code website, there actually *wasn't* one that could run on the PocketCHIP's ARM7 architecture. (ARM7 is what you'll find in the new Raspberry Pi, too.) 

Though the ARM7 architecture wasn't officially supported, and I'd never built a Linux application from source, and seemingly no one had ever installed VS Code on a PocketCHIP before... how hard could it be, right? (I hear all y'all Linux users laughing at last week's me. It's fine.)

There were a fair number of puzzles to solve in this process. For example, due to the PocketCHIP's limited specs, the `npm install` that brings in all the necessary modules for building from source results in an out-of-memory error. (Well, it actually just results in the `npm install` silently failing, but I eventually found the error logs and pieced it together.) So, to build VS Code on a PocketCHIP, I discovered that I needed to first create a 1 GB swapfile on a USB stick. Directions for how to do this are available [here](http://raspberrypimaker.com/adding-swap-to-the-raspberrypi/). (See "Arch Linux Swap," and thanks to [John Gerryts](https://twitter.com/phonikg) for the hot tip via twitter!) 

After a few late nights, a lot of dependency installations, and a little luck, my VS Code build worked. I was SO EXCITED when it compiled and popped up for the first time. It looked just like the PC and Mac versions!

That said, I'll admit that VS Code on PocketCHIP isn't a slam-dunk recommendation yet. It's a little buggy, and I'm not sure whether to attribute that to user error, the PocketCHIP's modest specs, or the fact that VS Code is somehow running on a niche device with a custom Debian OS that's only been out for a few weeks on architecture that's not officially supported.

I mostly took on this endeavor for the challenge, to be the first one to get this lovable IDE working on this lovable device. I learned a LOT about Linux and building from source. (Did I mention that I'd never even *used* Linux that much before last week?) In the course of this adventure, I also had a pull request accepted for VS Code's compile documentation, which was really exciting, and now I'm motivated to contribute to VS Code and perhaps even improve the ARM7 user experience! So. Worth. It. So much fun.

If you decide to Be Like Rae&trade; and build something from source on the PocketCHIP, here are a few tips and thoughts:

1. Instructions or guides might not exist for how to build a given source for the CHIP, but you might be able to find relevant guides for the ARM7 Raspberry Pi that you can tweak or use wholesale. (Just because a binary is marked as being "for Debian" doesn't mean that it will necessarily work on Debian on ARM7. Downloads marked *ia32* or *x64*, for example, are not what you're looking for.)
2. Consider that you might need to [create a swapfile for installation](http://raspberrypimaker.com/adding-swap-to-the-raspberrypi/). Don't forget to disable it when you're done.
3. If the program has an associated repository, search through the issues, readmes, and pull requests to see if your build has been done before.

## Blogging from PocketCHIP

If you look closely at the photo above, you'll see a piece of the code that generates the No Bad Memories webpage. As it turns out, I can even blog from my PocketCHIP! 

I recently built a website workflow ([DocPad](http://www.docpad.org) + [GitHub](http://www.github.com) + [Azure](http://azure.microsoft.com)) that allows me to author and post blog posts in plain old Markdown from just about anywhere, PocketCHIP included. I essentially just grab [my website's repository on GitHub](https://github.com/hxlnt/nobadmemories.com) from my PocketCHIP Terminal, author a new blog post in Markdown, and push changes back to the repository. Because I have Azure set to watch and recompile when the GitHub repository changes, the DocPad deployment script will be rerun and the website will be automatically served up with updates. No FTP, no local node process. Love it.

You don't need a fancy IDE like VS Code to get this working; any text editor will do. The key ingredients are git, which can be installed with the Terminal command `sudo apt-get install git`, and a GitHub repository dedicated to housing the DocPad source files.

I'll write this workflow up in a more detailed post soon, but in the meantime, [here's the first PocketCHIP-authored blog post I made](http://nobadmemories.com/blog/2016/08/whaaa-blogging-from-my-pocketchip).

## Oops! I bricked my PocketCHIP!

I won't ask you how it happened. But if you've bricked or somehow Really Screwed Up your PocketCHIP like I did once, you can make it all right again by reflashing it. Please note that reflashing restores your PocketCHIP to like-new condition (*i.e.,* your files and other downloads will be erased forever).

The PocketCHIP can very handily be reflashed using Next Thing Co.'s [web-based CHIP Flasher](http://flash.getchip.com/), which works on Mac and Windows. Choose PocketCHIP in the web app, then follow the instructions. You can bridge the FEL and ground pins without removing the CHIP from its casing; just use the breakout area at the top.

One thing that's really important to note is that reflashing seems to not work with USB 3.0 ports and is quite picky about the type of USB cable used. If you're on a computer that only has USB 3.0 ports, you can place an older USB hub between the PocketCHIP and the USB 3.0 port to "downgrade" it to USB 2.0. If you're having issues reflashing, you might want to try swapping out the micro-USB cable for one of higher quality.

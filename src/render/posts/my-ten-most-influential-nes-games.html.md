Throughout December, January, February, and March, I blogged about the ten NES games most influential to me. 

I realized that while I still feel good about the ten games I chose, I wish I'd chosen a slightly different order. So here's my newfangled and reordered top-ten list with links to each article.

1. *[Kirby's Adventure](/blog/2017/03/my-ten-most-influential-nes-games-1-kirbys-adventure)* "is a technical and aesthetic *masterpiece.*"

2. *[Otocky](/blog/2017/02/my-ten-most-influential-nes-games-7-otocky)* "beautifully dances on the line between experimental art game and traditional arcade shooter."

3. *[Hello Kitty World](/blog/2016/12/my-ten-most-influential-nes-games-3-hello-kitty-world)* "grabbed my attention as a teenager because it was challenging yet cute, made with superstar talent, and built on superstar IP."

4. *[Super Mario Bros.](/blog/2017/01/my-ten-most-influential-nes-games-5-super-mario-bros)* "continues to represent something above and beyond its gameness."

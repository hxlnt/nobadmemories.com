Throughout December, January, February, and March, I blogged about the ten NES games most influential to me. 

I realized that while I still feel good about the ten games I chose, I wish I'd chosen a slightly different order. So here's my newgangled and reordered top-ten list with links to each article.

1. *[Kirby's Adventure](/blog/2017/03/my-ten-most-influential-nes-games-1-kirbys-adventure)* "is a technical and aesthetic *masterpiece.*"
2. *[Otocky](/blog/2017/02/my-ten-most-influential-nes-games-7-otocky)* "beautifully dances on the line between experimental art game and traditional arcade shooter." 
3. *[Hello Kitty World](/blog/2016/12/my-ten-most-influential-nes-games-3-hello-kitty-world)* "grabbed my attention as a teenager because it was challenging yet cute, made with superstar talent, and built on superstar IP."
4. *[Super Mario Bros.](/blog/2017/01/my-ten-most-influential-nes-games-5-super-mario-bros)* "continues to represent something above and beyond its gameness." 
5. *[Pinball](/blog/2016/12/my-ten-most-influential-nes-games-4-pinball)* "planted the initial seed in my mind that I might like to begin collecting NES games."
6. *[Dance Aerobics](/blog/2016/12/my-ten-most-influential-nes-games-6-dance-aerobics)* "was one of the biggest inspirations for the first NES game that I released in 2012: *[TRACK+FEEL II](https://partytimehexcellent.itch.io/trackfeel-ii)*."
7. *[Barbie](/blog/2017/01/my-ten-most-influential-nes-games-8-barbie)* "is a fun diversion that's given me a lot to think about and inspiration in my own work."
8. *[Apple Town Monogatari: Little Computer People](/blog/2016/12/my-ten-most-influential-nes-games-10-apple-town-monogatari)* has "tiny, pixelated rooms whose smallest details are a pleasure to observe."
9. *[Zooming Secretary](/blog/2016/12/my-ten-most-influential-nes-games-2-zooming-secretary)* "was remarkable to me for raising the bar for NES homebrew games."
10. *[Tecmo Super Bowl](/blog/2016/12/my-ten-most-influential-nes-games-9-tecmo-super-bowl)* "seems to defy [the constraints of the NES]."

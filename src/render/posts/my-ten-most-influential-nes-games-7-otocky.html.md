With just two games left to discuss, I've come near the end of documenting my most personally-influential NES games. Today's article is dedicated to the whimsical musical-shooter, *Otocky* (ASCII, 1987).

I've tried my best to rank these ten games by how influential they've been. Now, after some reflection, I think *Otocky* belongs in a higher spot on the list than #7. But barring my going back and rewriting months of blog posts, there it remains.

*Otocky* is a Famicom Disk System game designed by interactive artist Toshio Iwai, who is better known for his cult-classic Nintendo DS game *Electroplankton* (and perhaps less known for his unreleased Super Famicom/SNES game [Sound Fantasy](https://www.unseen64.net/category/nin/super-nintendo/page/24/)).

Like *Electroplankton* and *Sound Fantasy*, *Otocky* defies genre boundaries by incorporating gentle, playful music composition mechanics. *Otocky* looks and plays a bit like a side-scrolling shooter, but it's much more. 

*Otocky* features an Astro Boy-esque hero who flies through various worlds, destroying enemies along the way. Your weapon is an 8-direction cosmic yo-yo of sorts, which bops baddies while playing a music note. As you shoot this weapon, you also create the level's soundtrack, and the carefully predetermined scales ensure that it's always a pleasant one. Throughout the game, you can acquire different "instruments" for your weapon, allowing for a variety of tones and melodies. This skillful tool-assisted speedrun shows a great playthrough of the game in under 20 minutes.

In addition to this main story mode, *Otocky* offers a freeplay mode devoid of enemies to allow you to focus on composing tunes. There's even a *Mario Paint*-esque music maker mode that lets you compose music.

There are so many things I love about *Otocky.* The art style is really interesting. I love the final stage in particular because it doesn't look NES-y to me. Music notes fly by in a dizzying array of colors thanks to rolling palette and attribute table rewrites. It's a great effect.

*Otocky* was pretty pivotol for me as an NES developer. It beautifully dances on the line between experimental art game and traditional arcade shooter. It's unique yet has broad appeal&mdash;there's something for everybody&mdash;which is something I really admire. And *Otocky*, alongside *[Dance Aerobics](/blog/2016/12/my-ten-most-influential-nes-games-6-dance-aerobics)*, is a big inspiration for my really early work making chiptune composition games, music-puzzlers, and *TRACK+FEEL II* for the NES.

Thanks to the weird and wonderful *Otocky!*

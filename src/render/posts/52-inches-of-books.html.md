I recently decided to thin out the book collection in my studio space. It was a surprisingly emotional task! So many books have been so influential and inspirational to me, and now it's hard to part with them.

My books are like little mementos; I remember each one's origin story. *Féminismes Électriques* was an impulse buy at an art gallery gift shop in Montréal, *Thread of Fate* was a gift from Brandon, *Atari Color Graphics* was an incredibly lucky find in the bargain section of Half-Price Books... 

There's certainly some subconscious aspect to one's bookshelf that's meant to declare, "Hey, visitor, look at my fine array of eclectic books that illustrate how quirky and scholarly [or insert other adjectives here] I am!" I'm guilty of that kind of thinking. Though as far as I know, no one has ever visited my studio space and reviewed the contents of my bookshelf. Only in my imagination do my friends nod, tracing a finger across the spines, declaring, "Hmmm, yes, fine selection of oboslete technical manuals and toy collecting guides!"

In my studio, I have one of those IKEA shelving grids&mdash;you know, the ones with 13" cubbies that perfectly fit records?&mdash;where all my books live. My goal was to reduce my collection of books from seven full cubbies to four. That's 52 inches of books.

I made the arbitrary decision to exclude comic books and zines from these shelves but to allow longer-form graphic novels and manga. My thought here is that comics and zines don't really stand up on their own in bookshelf world: too floppy, no spine, easily crushed by hardback books and negligent reshelving. I prefer to keep 'em in binders or portfolios. So, comics and zines get their own cubby. OK.

Here's what I decided to keep in the four book cubbies. No showboating, no misty-memories books, no assembly language workbooks that changed my life forever but basically haven't been cracked open since 2011. Only books that actually get referenced or read regularly made the cut. (Or, in the rare case, a book that I expect to reference soon. But this is trecherous territory, so I tried to be judicious in including these.) All other books got boxed up to go into storage. I'll deal with that problem at some later time. Right? Riiiight?

If the mood strikes you, nod along as you whisper, "Oh, I read a chapter of this in art school..."

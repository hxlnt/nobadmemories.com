Earlier this year, I illustrated an Ivysaur trading card for *Pokézine 4.* 

*Pokézine 4* was an indie trading card collection meant to be funded via [Kickstarter](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/rsnbrgjrdn/pokezine-4/posts/2014218), but it fell short of its  goal. It's too bad, as there were some great artists contributing illustrated cards, including [Jake Lawrence](https://timecowboy.tumblr.com/), [MILKBBI](https://milkbbi.com/), and [Thymine](http://thymine.tumblr.com/). 

The good news is that *Pokézine 4* is slated to release... in some other format... at some point in the future. Until then, please enjoy my Ivysaur illustration, which is just about the right size for phone wallpaper.

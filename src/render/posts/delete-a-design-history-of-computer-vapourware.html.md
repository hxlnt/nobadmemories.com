I recently had the opportunity to review Paul Atkinson’s book *[Delete: A Design History of Computer Vapourware](http://www.amazon.com/Delete-Design-History-Computer-Vapourware/dp/0857853473/ref=asap_bc?ie=UTF)*.

*Delete* is highly recommended for those interested in computer hardware design or retrocomputing. The volume is packed with gorgeous, never-before-seen color images of computers that were announced but never commercially produced. Atkinson’s interviews with the designers and executives closest to these unrealized products are fascinating.

My in-depth review of *Delete* can be found in the latest issue of *Design and Culture*. The [PDF](http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/pdf/10.1080/17547075.2015.1051846) is available for free online. You can also [browse the photo collection](https://www.flickr.com/photos/9574086@N02/collections/72157608812198325/) of former Sinclair Research designer Rick Dickinson, who worked on a number of the unrealized products chronicled in *Delete*.

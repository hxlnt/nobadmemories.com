Last month, I got to catch up with the amazingly talented [Nathalie Lawhead](http://alienmelon.com/), creator of [Tetrageddon Games](http://tetrageddon.com/) and [Everything is Going to Be OK](https://alienmelon.itch.io/everything-is-going-to-be-ok), while she was in town for [Fantastic Arcade](http://www.fantasticarcade.com). 

I forget how it all started, but at some point during the weekend, Nathalie and I got some newsprint and markers and began drawing absurd bits and pieces out of an imagined teen magazine. The drawings ended up scattered all over my studio, which has been a fun reminder of Fantastic Arcade but also not a great Archival Strategy. One of Nathalie's sketches, however, contained a subtle clue as to what I could do with all the drawings:

...and so I did! Please enjoy this PDF of [*Circle Yes or No*](https://hxlntblob.blob.core.windows.net/nbm/circleyesorno-dec2017.pdf), a zine about dating, hamburgers, and smooching the void.

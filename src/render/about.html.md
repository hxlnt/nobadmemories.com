Rachel Simone Weil (b. 1984) is an experimental designer whose work offers alternate visions of computer and video game history. Weil blends fact with fiction to create exhibitions, written works, and electronic artifacts that center the history of forgotten and imagined games, especially those that draw from girly cultures and subcultures. Her work has been shown internationally at venues such as the <a href="http://www.dma.org/" target="new">Dallas Museum of Art</a>, the <a href="http://platformgallery.org" target="new">Platform Centre for Digital and Photographic Arts</a>, and the <a href="http://www.vam.ac.uk" target="new">Victoria and Albert Museum</a>. Weil’s critical design projects are united by the mantra “No Bad Memories,” the slogan of a long-defunct floppy disk maker.

Weil has a BA in Chemistry and an MFA in Design. She currently works as a technical evangelist at <a href="http://www.microsoft.com" target="new">Microsoft</a>. In addition, she heads up <a href="http://www.femicom.org/" target="new">FEMICOM Museum</a> and helps run numerous indie game events in Austin, TX, including <a href="http://www.fantasticarcade.com/" target="new">Fantastic Arcade</a>, <a href="http://www.juegosrancheros.com/" target="new">Juegos Rancheros</a>, and the <a href="http://juegosrancheros.com/the-museum-of-human-amusement/" target="new">Museum of Human Amusement</a>.

Howdy! I'm Rachel Simone Weil, an experimental designer whose work offers alternate visions of computer and video game history. I blend fact with fiction to create exhibitions and electronic artifacts that center the history of forgotten and imagined games, especially those that draw from girly cultures and subcultures. My work has been shown internationally at venues such as the <a href="http://livingcomputers.org" target="new">Living Computers Museum</a>, <a href="http://www.dma.org/" target="new">Dallas Museum of Art</a>, and the <a href="http://www.vam.ac.uk" target="new">V&A Museum</a> in London. My games, glitch art, and graphic design are united by the mantra "No Bad Memories," the slogan of a long-defunct floppy disk maker.

I have a BA in Chemistry and an MFA in Design. I currently work on F12 tools for the Edge browser <a href="http://www.microsoft.com" target="new">Microsoft</a>. I also run <a href="http://www.femicom.org/" target="new">FEMICOM Museum</a>, a digital and physical archive of 20th-century femme tech.

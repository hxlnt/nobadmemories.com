I'm excited to share that this month, I'm the artist in residence at [Welcome to My Homepage](https://www.welcometomyhomepage.net/). My web-based piece is called *PFFT: An evastars retrospective.*

The work is both personal and eclectic, bringing together just about every element of my artistic practice as well as some new (to me) territory. I can't say too much more now, but I'm looking forward to sharing it over the next few weeks.

You can find *PFFT* and other Welcome to My Homepage works at [welcometomyhomepage.net](https://www.welcometomyhomepage.net/).

*Update:* PFFT: An evastars retrospective *is no longer accessible through welcometomyhomepage.net but is permanently available via [this link](http://femicom.org/fun/pfft/).*

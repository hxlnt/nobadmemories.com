I recently had the opportunity to review Paul Atkinson’s book *[Delete: A Design History of Computer Vapourware](http://www.amazon.com/Delete-Design-History-Computer-Vapourware/dp/0857853473/ref=asap_bc?ie=UTF)*.

*Delete* is highly recommended for those interested in computer hardware design or retrocomputing. The volume is packed with gorgeous images of computers that were announced but never commercially produced. Atkinson’s interviews with the designers and executives closest to these unrealized products are fascinating.

My in-depth review of *Delete* can be found in the latest issue of *Design and Culture*. The [PDF](http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/pdf/10.1080/17547075.2015.1051846) is available for free online. You can also [browse the photo collection](https://www.flickr.com/photos/9574086@N02/collections/72157608812198325/) of former Sinclair Research designer Rick Dickinson, who worked on a number of the unrealized products chronicled in *Delete*.

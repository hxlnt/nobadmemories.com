intro: "<p><strong>Printmaking as play</strong><br><em>Posted Tuesday, May 17 2022</em></p>"

As may be known from my research on games and toys like [the Casio Loopy](http://www.femicom.org/collection/loopy/), and [Barbie Fashion Designer](http://www.femicom.org/research/jesyca-durchin-on-the-making-of-barbie-fashion-designer/), I have a special interest in games and toys that incorporate printing or image making as a play mechanic. Printmaking toys make creation immediate, convenient, and playful, often at the expense of the quality, quantity, permanence, or general perceived value of the resulting image. Toys require neither prerequisite training nor access to specialty facilities. For me, these are benefits printmaking toys have over their "real" counterparts. Like Sadie Benning with the Fisher-Price Pixelvision camera or [Nullsleep](https://www.nullsleep.com) with the Nintendo Game Boy, I use post-consumer toys to achieve activist, countercultural, and recuperative ends.

Recently, I became curious about the space between printmaking toy and printmaking instrument, and whether I could create something for my own use that was suitably simple, expressive, and, of course, fun.

The Print Gocco was a popular at-home printing device produced by Riso Kagaku starting in the late 1970s. The process combined elements from mimeography, stamping, and screenprinting to allow users to produce small color prints for greeting cards and textiles. While marketed to adults, its chunky design and ease of use gave it a toy-like quality.

I learned about the Print Gocco in the mid-2000s, just as it was being discontinued by the manufacturer. The [grassroots "Save Gocco" campaign](http://savegocco.blogspot.com/2009/02/tribute-to-jill-bliss-save-gocco.html) had just begun, and a market developed for remaining deadstock of the device's proprietary consumables. My partner very thoughtfully gifted me a complete Print Gocco set from eBay, which I promptly... stored away safely. After all, the consumables are getting so hard to find! It's *collectible!* It wasn't until I saw a second Print Gocco at a local resale shop that I was inspired to pull mine off the shelf and put it to use.

The Print Gocco is very easy to use, compact, relatively tidy, and produces acceptible, if not quirky, color prints. Master production is fast and can be made from a simple black-and-white photocopy on plain paper. The device is portable, powered by two AA batteries. While producing prints requires a bit of dexterity and practice, it is suitable for small runs of maybe 100 prints or fewer. 

From my perspective, the Print Gocco system hits an excellent sweet spot between playful and professional. However, it does have some drawbacks:
 - It requires the use of hard-to-find proprietary consumables&mdash;Print Gocco masters, inks, and flashbulbs, etc.&mdash;all of which have not been produced for decades. 
 - Print Gocco masters and flashbulbs are single use. (The flashbulbs literally explode when fired.)
 - The flashbulbs and inks smell absolutely awful. The inks' ingredients are not listed, but I suspect they are made of pigment suspended in a soybean oil carrier that, after a few decades, has now gone rancid.
 - While delicate designs with text or medium-fine lines look OK, the quality can be variable, especially with more densely-colored images that cause ink to pool, creating visible veins when the master is pressed or smudges when released.

<figcaption>These are two prints from my first use of the Print Gocco, featuring a lovely illustration by <a href="https://twitter.com/elloradatura" target="_blank">Gabrielle Genevieve</a>. All colors were imprinted in a single pass, made possible by the fact that the inks are firm and resistant to blending when pressed. In retrospect, the inclusion of gradients and coloring the telephone yellow didn't really work well, but that's on me. You can see that this image was a challenge for the Print Gocco: there is considerable smudging and veining due to the density of the image.</figcaption>

So, how to make Print Gocco better?

The company that produced the Print Gocco, Riso Kagaku, is still in operation. Today, they're best known for their line of Risograph machines: sophisticated, digitized Print Goccos that work and look more like commercial copy machines and produce high-resolution poster-size prints. In recent years, Risograph printing has seen a surge of interest among a cohort of illustrators, designers, and zinesters who laud its economical per-print price and distinctive look. Like tube amplifiers, Risograph printing is often described by its fans in terms of its imperfections, constraints, and "analog" or "warm" qualities.

Admittedly, I am drawn to the look of Risograph prints, too. The bright, lightly-speckled ink on newsprint-like paper reminded me of... *something*. Old comic books, maybe? I took a Risograph workshop offered at a local university a few years ago and appreciated how quick and easy the process was compared to letterpress and screenprinting. I came home inspired, wondering how I could do more Risograph printing. Turns out: I couldn't. Not easily, at least. 

Risograph machines aren't as ubiquitous as the copy machine or digital printing services. Where I live, there are only a handful of Risograph machines owned by universities and artist collectives, none of which offer Risograph printing to the public. I briefly had the idea to get together enough money to purchase a Risograph machine that could be made available in a local artspace as a community resource, but after I reached out to a licensed distributor, the company *literally sent two men in suits to my home* to size me up and determine whether I was a "legitimate buyer." Subsequently, they recommended some inkjet printers instead, declined to tell me how much a Risograph machine might cost, and finally stopped responding to my emails altogether. 

Intimidation tactics aside, the Risograph is too far from my current search for a simpler, toy-like printing experience. It's large, expensive, and requires lots of specialty equipment and maintenance. So on we go.

I began to wonder if the Print Gocco device could be retrofitted with other, more ordinary or readily-replenishable materials&mdash;modern inks, a reusable light source&mdash;that could offer improved sustainability and print quality. Stay tuned to see what I came up with!
